# BO-Java-Stock-Screener

I developed a web-based stock screener using the FastAPI framework which is Python framework built on Starlette. A number of FastAPI features were used such as dependency injection, pydantic models, background tasks. In order to interact with the database SQLAlchemy was utilised and the Yahoo finance API was used to collect real time stock data.
